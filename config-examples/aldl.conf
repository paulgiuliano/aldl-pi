BUFFER=100 .. how many records to buffer.  theoretically it only costs memoory,
              as linked lists are incredibly cheap to maintain ..
START=15 .. how many records finished before plugins are 'good to go' ..
            keep in mind that everything is on hold for START * n_records/sec
            so dont set this way too high ..

MINMAX=1 .. if this option is set, min/max values are enforced during conv ..

MAXFAIL=6  .. how many packets in a row are failed before desync is assumed ..

ACQRATE=500  .. throttle acquisition in microseconds to lessen cpu load ..
