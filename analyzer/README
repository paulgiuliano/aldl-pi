This is a utility to read a whole ton of various log entries and make some
sense out of them.

It is non-interactive, and simply performs logical analysis of the logs based
on various parameters and thresholds.  Temperature and minimum timestamps are
checked to attempt to discard bad data.

Not really tested or designed for anything but an LT1.

Requires fully manual configuration for log column numbering, doesn't use the
aldl-io definition file at all.

It includes the following analyzers:

- Wideband AFR vs MAF (For MAF Tuning)
- Wideband AFR vs MAP vs RPM (For VE Tuning)
- Wideband AFR vs RPM in PE MODE (For PE Tuning)
- BLM Cell Ranges & Averages per RPM, MAP, MAF, and trim (for BLM optimization)
- Knock count increment events vs MAP vs RPM (for timing tuning)

Instructions:

$ make & make install

Have a look at /etc/aldl/analyzer.conf

You can disable various modules (wideband is disabled by default).  You have to
manually configure column numbers for EVERY relavent peice of data in your log,
it is pre-configured for the default LT1 configuration file that comes with the
matching version of the aldl-io package.

Then run it:
$ aldl-analyzer file1.csv file2.csv | less

Use and trust at your own risk...
